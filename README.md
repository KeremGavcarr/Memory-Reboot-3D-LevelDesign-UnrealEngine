# Memory Reboot

"Memory Reboot" is an atmospheric horror game developed using Unreal Engine 5.3. This project serves as a capstone project for the "GAM504E Essentials of 3D Modeling: From Design to Implementation" course at Istanbul Technical University. The game explores the dark and eerie environment of an abandoned hospital, where the protagonist, Chris, navigates through terrifying encounters to uncover the truth behind mysterious disappearances.

## Project Overview

### Game Concept
In "Memory Reboot," players assume the role of Chris, a newspaper reporter investigating an abandoned hospital notorious for mysterious disappearances, including that of his girlfriend, Lily. The game begins with Chris and Lily arriving by helicopter, which crashes upon arrival, leaving Chris alone to explore the dark corridors filled with monstrous creatures and uncover the hospital's dark history.

### Key Features
- **Atmospheric Dynamic Lighting**: I utilized Unreal Engine 5's capabilities to create a dynamic lighting system that enhances the eerie atmosphere.
- **Interactive NPC Behavior**: The game includes unique behaviors for the hospital's monstrous inhabitants, providing an unpredictable experience.
- **Psychological Challenges**: Puzzles and challenges are designed to test players' problem-solving skills and psychological resilience.
- **Realistic Sound Design**: 3D audio immerses players in the haunting sounds of the hospital, enhancing the overall horror experience.
- **Non-Linear Storytelling**: A narrative that unfolds based on player choices, allowing for multiple story paths and endings.
